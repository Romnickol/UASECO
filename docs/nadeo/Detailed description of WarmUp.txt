'Trackmania.WarmUp.Start' and 'Trackmania.WarmUp.End' are callbacks sent at the beginning and the end of the "traditional" TM warm up system where you see your time displayed in orange.

'Trackmania.WarmUp.End' and 'Trackmania.WarmUp.EndRound' are methods that you can call during a Trackmania warm up to end the whole warm up or the current round if there are several.

'Maniaplanet.WarmUp.Start' and 'Maniaplanet.WarmUp.End' are callbacks sent at the beginning and the end of the "global" warm up system that is used mainly in Shootmania but also in TM Chase.
In this kind of warm up players can take a slot in the team of their choice and choose when they are ready to start the match.

'Maniaplanet.WarmUp.Stop' is a method that allows a server controller to force the end of the warm up and the beginning of the match.

The 'Maniaplanet.WarmUp.GetStatus' only triggers the 'Maniaplanet.WarmUp.Status' if the warm up library is implemented into the game mode.
It is planned to improve it so every game mode answers and say if it supports the warm up system or not.
